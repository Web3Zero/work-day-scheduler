# work-day-scheduler

I have created a work day scheduler which uses Javascript to create HTML. 

The JS creates time blocks with the following functions:
1. time blocks are set to work hours
2. the color changes depending on whether it is past present or future
3. there is a running clock displaying local time at the top of the page
4. you can type into the time blocks

Here is a screenshot of the page.
